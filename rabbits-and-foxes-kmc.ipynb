    "There are initially 400 rabbits and 200 foxes on a farm (but it could be two cell types in a 96 well plate or something, if you prefer bio-engineering analogies). Plot the concentration of foxes and rabbits as a function of time for a period of up to 600 days. The predator-prey relationships are given by the following set of coupled ordinary differential equations:\n",
